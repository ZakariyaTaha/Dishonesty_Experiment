# Dishonesty_Experiment

In this project, we are going to analyze data from an experiment about honesty. Oftentimes, we are asked to confirm our honest intentions by signing at the end of a document. For example, in tax returns or insurance policy forms, we are often asked to sign our names under a text that reads something like "I hereby certify that the above statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge."
